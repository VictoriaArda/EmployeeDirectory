## Usage 
This was primarily made to meet the requirements of a homework assignment. 


## Contributing 
I was the only one to work on this project.

## Challenges
The major challenge was using React for the first time. I built out my components before thinking about how I would pass values around through components, which resulted in me having to learn how to implement the handle useContext. This allowed me to pass around the employees and update them without having to worry about parent child relationships to allow for prop passing.
